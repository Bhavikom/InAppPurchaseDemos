Google Play Billing can be used to sell the following types of in-app products:

1.....One-time products: An in-app product requiring a single, non-recurring charge to the user's form of payment. Additional game levels, premium loot boxes, and media files are examples of one-time products. The Google Play Console refers to one-time products as managed products, and the Google Play Billing library calls them "INAPP".


2.... Subscriptions: An in-app product requiring a recurring charge to the user's form of payment. Online magazines and music streaming services are examples of subscriptions. The Google Play Billing Library calls these "SUBS".
